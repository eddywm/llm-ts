LLM Transformer Model Implemented in Typescript.

This is an experimental transofrmer project coded entirely in Typescript.

The transformer model includes:
- Token embeddings and positional encoding
- Multi-head self-attention mechanism
- Feed-forward networks with GELU activation
- Layer normalization and residual connections
- Causal masking for autoregressive generation
- Matrix operations optimized for transformer architecture
